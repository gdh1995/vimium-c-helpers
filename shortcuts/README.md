This web extension provides 32 global shortcut placeholders,
and it will forward all shortcut messages to another (configurable) extension.

[阅读中文介绍](README_zh.md)（description in Chinese）。

The common usage of this extension is to forward all shortcuts to [Vimium C - All by Keyboard](
  https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c),
and then you may trigger Vimium C's tens of commands easily, without taking care of what modes you're currently in.

For example, if you:
* specify <kbd>Alt+Shift+H</kbd> for "Custom Shortcut 1" in the shortcut settings page (chrome://extensions/shortcuts),
* and add `shortcut userCustomized1 command="showHelp"` to Vimium C's custom key mappings,
* then you'll be able to trigger Vimium C's help panel by <kbd>Alt+Shift+H</kbd>,
  even when a text box or Vomnibar is showing and focused.

Please note that, if you have modified some options of Vimium C, you may need to add this extension id
  (clnalilglegcjmlgenoppklmfppddien, on MS Edge and Chrome) to Vimium C's "Allow list of other extension IDs" settings.

This web extension takes over your browser's new tab settings,
and it can move the focus of a new tab from address bar to page content.

This extension runs [Vimium C - All by Keyboard](
  https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c)'s content scripts on its newtab page by default,
while this feature can be disabled by an advanced option.
